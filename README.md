Playground for exploring FP ideas in Swift

This is totally, completely unstable stuff. I promise nothing here. Its just public because people might be interested in some
nontrivial applications I'm exploring.

This is a Swift 2 implementation using "throw" to manage errors rather than Result.
See the SWIFT1 tag for another version that used Result (doesn't compile under Swift2).
